title: Ekylibre 0.3.2.1 has been released
name: ekylibre-0-3-2-1

This version fixes mainly the Debian/Ubuntu package.

It adds unsatisfied depdencies. The new install script is more all-terrain. On the other hand, it breaks with Debian logic building a part of its dependencies to ensure good version availibity (rubygems, rake et passenger).
